_TL;DR;_

* Busy week at work.
* Met a bunch of new fellow Greeks.
* Weekend fun.

## Busy week at work

Oof, I am trying to remember the last time I worked so much during a week. The deadline was on Friday. We made it, but I had to work overtime every day. It'll be a while until I do that again as an employee.

## Met fellow Greeks

On Thursday morning, I saw this post on LinkedIn from a connection. He asked who was around in London to meet for a drink Thursday night. I've met the guy twice in my life. Coincidentally both times were on a start-up weekend. He was the judge on the second one. He's been running a business for the past 8-9 years. Probably has more side projects, but I think that's his main gig.

There were 9 of us. I may have been the only "loser" not running their own gig. I'll get there. I read this article once, where everyone is in their own "timezone". My watch is still syncing...

## Weekend fun

Saturday, I went to this Batman concert. It saw the entire movie basically, but with a live orchestra playing the songs. It was... interesting. They were terrific; solid performance on their end. I'm not sure that I'd watch something like that again. I will be bold and say it was not worth the value. Next time hopefully, it'll be something like Dragon Ball Symphonic Adventure üêâ.

Sunday was: _It's lights out, and away we go_ üèéÔ∏è! Fernando Alonso's second podium on the second race this weekend! I'm so happy to see this man smashing it. Red bull 1-2; no surprise there. The next race is on the 2nd of April.
