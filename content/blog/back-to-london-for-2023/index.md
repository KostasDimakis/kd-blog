_TL;DR;_

* Easing back to work.
* Workouts going strong.
* Meeting up with friends over the weekend.

## Easing back to work

When you return to work and don't remember how to write code, you've done an excellent job on your vacation. A pretty solid break 😉.

## Workouts going strong 🏋🏻

Man, the workouts I'm doing right now are kicking my butt. I'm burning ~500 calories in 50 minutes lifting weights, while usually it's been ~300. It's back-to-back and high-intensity. So far, I'm enjoying it. I'll be increasing the food I eat cause the workouts make me super hungry.

## Catching up with friends over the weekend

Saturday and Sunday were pretty chill. Saturday, I walked around central London with a Greek friend. We ended up walking for like ~3 hours 😅. A lot to talk about, I guess. Sunday, I grabbed something from Nando's with another friend. Both conversations included the "let's make money doing X" rant 😂.

That's it for now. The first week has been pretty chill. Time to catch up on some 💤.
