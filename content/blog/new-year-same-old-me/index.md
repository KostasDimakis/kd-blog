_TL;DR;_

* I Spent the week visiting my parents in my hometown.
* Skipped studying.
* Gym.
* New year celebrations.
* New year goals?

Happy new year, everyone 🎇.

## Hometown visit

I've really enjoyed this past week. I visited my parents and went to shops and coffee houses every day. There were also lots of board games with the parents. Most of all, though, we enjoyed playing cards, a game called "Ξερή".

## No studying this year!

This week has been stagnant, studying-wise. I had a blast back home, so I'm not bothered! After all, I'll be back in London next week, so I'll have plenty of time to focus on it then.

## Gym 🏋🏻

I kept up the cardio and gym sessions. In fact, I joined a local gym 5 minutes away from my house. It was really well-geared. I worked that squat machine on leg day 🦵🏻.

## New year celebrations

On New Year's Eve, I was back in Chalkida. It was the typical New Years' Eve night. Friends, relatives, and plenty of delicious food and drinks.

## My new year goals

I'm not a believer in new year's resolutions. I've never had any success with them; many people don't. Instead, I'm going to say that I'd like to stay the same this year. I like who I am and how I'm approaching my life now, and I'll keep going!
