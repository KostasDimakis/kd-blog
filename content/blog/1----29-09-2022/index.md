_TD;DR;_

* I'm getting to old
* Starting a blog to fix my life.
* Goals.
* Twice a week check-ins.

### What's wrong?

Well, I'll be honest. My life is not how I imagined it would be in my age. I'm 31yo. I've literally haven't done a single thing in my life that I am proud of. Which is funny cause that's how I feel. If you ask my friends how they see me, they probably see a proper professional, working at a decent company, earning a decent salary and seemingly having my life together. But that's not the case. I have so many things I want to accomplish that I honestly can no longer sit back and just wait for the perfect moment. Enough is enough.

### How will starting a blog help?

Writing in public. I think this trend has always been around but I think it really became popular by [Pieter Levels (@levelsio)](https://twitter.com/levelsio). I think the idea of doing things in public, probably helps cause you feel like you have a responisiblity to follow through. We'll see if that'll work for me or not. The overall thing I'm hoping to achieve with starting a blog is a shift of all of my mental efforts towards accompishing something that I'll be proud of. And hopefully have a snowball effect and I'll keep wanting more of it.

### What am I going to be writing about.

Since I'm planning to use this blog as a means to keep me accountable then I think starting with posts about weekly goals is probably a good idea. Thus, the format will be simple. Reporting [](https://)on last week's goals, and planning for the next. Maybe an odd, long blog post about things that I contemplate in life? I don't want to be writing essays every time. I'm going to try and keep things simple and concise. Reporting on the previous week's goals and what I learned and planning for the week ahead.

### Writing frequency

I want to start out by keeping it small. As I've mentioned, writing blog posts is to keep me accountable towards my goals.

I think writing everyday is not really going to help. Am I going to have big things to report in a cohesive way that justifies writing daily? I don't think so.

How about writing weekly? Nope. Writing weekly is too late. If I'm planning for the blogging process to keep me accountable, then by the end of the week is too late.

So what then? Let's approach this in an expiremental way. Let's start with 1 mid-week check-in on Wednesday and a proper report on Sunday where I'll also be stating my goals for the week.

Well, that's it for now. Hopefully my next post is going to be Sunday where I'll be setting some goals for the week ahead. Until then stay awesome üòé. Peace ‚úåüèª.
