_TL;DR;_

* Quiet week.
* Saturday walk
* Lots of studying.

## Quiet-ish week

A little to say for this week. It's been another quiet week. Continuing with my training sessions. I put on more weight this week than I intended. I did have a couple of cheat meals but still. If this continues next week, I must bump up the cardio.

## Saturday walk around London

I caught up with a greek friend on Saturday. Classic tour of London streets with a cup of cappuccino from Capro in hand ðŸ˜…. I'm greek, after all.

## Web3 studying

I'm about done with the web3 program that I was studying. I've done a final project, and I'm waiting for the last review. It was alright. A bit outdated, but the concepts still apply today. It's the tech stack that was outdated. Next up, I'll shape up my resume a little bit. I'm not job hunting or anything; I like things to be updated.
