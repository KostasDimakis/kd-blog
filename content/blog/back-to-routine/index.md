_TL;DR;_

* Spent the day out in London
* Goal 1: Get back to work/workout routine
* Goal 2: "fitness workflow"
* Goal 3: Roam around London when free

## Sunny day

Such a lovely weather today! Got the usual fredo cappuccino from [one of the few places that make it in London](https://carpoworld.com), strolled around the city and caught up with my friend Nick from Crete.

## The week ahead

Well, here I am. Week #1 and sticking to the plan.

I'll keep things simple for this week. I mainly want to get back to my usual routine. This means: morning cardio, work, weights during the break and completely free after 17:30. For this week, I won't force myself into anything past 17:30 except for the thing below.

I want is to develop my "fitness workflow". This is the last week I'll have a personal trainer looking after my diet and my training. I've decided for various reasons to give it a go on my own for a while. So this means that I'll keep going with sticking to a specific diet and sticking to working out a set number of days in a week.

So there we have it.

* [ ]  Morning cardio, work, weights during the break
* [ ]  Develop my "fitness workflow"
* [ ]  Roam around London if not working on "fitness-workflow"


Alright! Time to catch up on my üò¥. Check-in on Wednesday. Until then stay awesome üòé. Peace ‚úåüèª.
