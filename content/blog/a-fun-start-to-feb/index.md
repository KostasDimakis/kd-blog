_TL;DR;_

* Switched teams at work. Back to my old code base.
* Web3 program DONE.
* Weekend fun.

## Work

My company has been through a big merger recently, and I was one of the devs that got moved to help with a transition on the codebase of the other company. It's been an interesting few months. Almost felt like I'm a contractor at times; plenty of pressure to deliver. Now I'm back to my old team's codebase. Plenty of challenges to tackle, and all seem to be unique, device-specific and "hard" bugs. I welcome the challenge ðŸ¤ª.

## Web3 studying âœ…

Happy to report that I've finished studying web3. I submitted the final 2 projects recently and am pleased with the results. It's definitely an exciting space. There are some solid use cases for blockchain tech. On the other hand, I don't know about crypto. [You can't have apolitical money](https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2021/08/02/what-is-money/).

## Fun Saturday & Sunday

Saturday, I caught up over food and coffee with a couple of Greek friends in central London. Had a nice long walk in Hyde park as well. It's been a while since I've been there.
