## Cutting but secretly bulking ðŸ¤«

It's been another chaotic week in terms of nutrition. A friend is visiting from Greece, and I have been eating out daily. Also, on Friday and Sunday, we visited another friend cause of his birthday and stuffed our faces. I'm not proud of it, but I ate a huge piece of tiramisu on Sunday. His last attempt at it was more successful. He agreed as well ðŸ˜…

In terms of workouts, I still managed to include morning walks and weight-lifting sessions. Next week is the start of proper Keto for 1.5 to 2 months. I am not going for a "competition look" this time. I'll be satisfied if I see some results in the mirror; that's it.

## Work

Only a little to report here. I've joined my old video team again; catching up with them is fun. Let's see how long it'll take me to adjust.
