_TL;DR;_

* Chill week.
* Busy weekend.
* Final 3-week stretch for bulking.

## Chill week

Nothing notable happened during the week. Work is rolling like usual, but there are a lot of deadlines for next Friday, and as far as I can tell, all teams are rushing to deliver. Front-end and back-end across all client teams. This leads me to my next point.

## Busy weekend

The weekend I met a friend on Sunday morning for coffee and a walk around central London. But other than that, I was writing code for work on Saturday and Sunday nights. The deadline is next Friday, and there's a lot of stuff left to do. It's all about the sunset experience of HBO Max in the US. We want to make it as seamless as possible. Lovely pages, with nice messaging, deep links to TV app stores to download the new app and other things. We'll get there...

## Final bulking stretch

I'm in the last 3 weeks of the bulking phase. Eating quite a lot. My weight is alright for now. I  can barely see my abs now, so maybe I've gone too far ðŸ˜…. Nah, it's all good; I'll lose it all.
